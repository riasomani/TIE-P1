        <p class="aboutInfo">Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. <br>
        Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. <br>
        Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p>

        <h1 class="aboutHeading">About the Second Wave of Covid-19</h1>
        <p class="aboutInfo">The second wave of COVID-19 in India has had severe consequences in the form  of spiralling cases, reduced supplies of essential treatments, and increased deaths particularly in the young population. <br>
        Patients in the first wave infected with SARS-CoV-2 were predominantly older than 60 years and those with comorbid conditions were at increased risk of death. However, surprisingly, younger adults appear to be prone to infection during this latest cycle and many patients have died at a young age, including patients aged between 25 and 50 years. <br>
        However, an important observation as the situation develops is that every individual appeared to have equal risk of being infected with the virus, but the ability to sustain and overcome infection was variable among individuals. Some people with presumed suboptimal immune responses could survive, and some individuals, despite having presumed stronger immunity, could not overcome the rapid infection. A further observation in the peak of the second wave was the sudden decrease in the oxygen saturation of some patients, even when they were recovering well, giving less time for the proper ventilation support. This situation created fear and panic among patients and family members as there was uncertainty around whether the patients would survive the viral infection even when showing signs of recovery.</p>

        <p class="aboutInfo">The Second Wave of Novel Coronavirus made people fear death. It made people numb towards the feeling of occurences of death or even stepping out of their homes for that matter. Apart from that there were so many families that were devastated mentally and financially if not physically and no one knew what the next minute holds for them. The aftermath still continues, people have for sure started taking things for less granted but the fear makes them pray everyday that the worst days never come again and from here on things get nothing but better, still exists.</p>
